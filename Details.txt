Details on how to run the code:

1)  At first it will ask the user whether it's his first time or not(press '0' if yes else press '1' ).

2)  If the user enters 0 it will automatically create the required files containing the predefined inputs ie.. 10 heroes,heroines,directors, their respective ratings 
     and five already running movies(which is fixed).

3)  Then the user will be asked to enter the number of newly released movies, its cast whose ratings will be used to calculate the demand rate of the movie. 
      If the user gives new cast as input it will be appended to the existing list and it will be given a default rating.

4)  Then the user will be asked to enter the seats that are unbooked for the already five running movies for the week.

5)  These unbooked seats will be used to calculate the success rates for the already running movies. 
      The movie with the highest success rate will be alloted the maximum number of screens ie..6 , then 4,3,2,1 based on the decreasing order of priority.

6)  The list will be sorted based the success rate of already running movies and demand scores of newly released movies.

7)  Then in the terminal it will display the movie name with screen numbers along with the show timings(3 slots for weekdays and 5 slots for weekends).

8)  When the code is executed again the user has to enter 1. The newly released movies of previous execution will be updated in the aready running movies list.
